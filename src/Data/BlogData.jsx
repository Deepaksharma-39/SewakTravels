    desc_one:`Your first step in how to start planning a trip is to choose a travel destination that meets your interests and travel budget.Are you planning overseas travel or a domestic trip at home? Either way, the whole idea of taking a trip is to have a memorable time, to have fun and relax, and not to spend your whole vacation time worrying about money.If you only have 1-2 weeks of vacation time per year, don’t waste too much of that time traveling to and from your destination. Plan your trip
    accordingly.But if you have 2-4 weeks or over a month you can look at taking an overseas trip or traveling further within your home country.`,
    desc_two:`Once you have chosen your destination, step two in planning a trip is to book your flights. And learning how to find cheap flights will help you to reduce one of your biggest travel expenses. As a traveling family, if it’s an overseas trip and a long haul flight I like to plan my trip so we get to our destination as quickly as possible, with the most amount of comfort and facilities our budget allows! If it’s your one-and-only dream vacation for the year, and you only have 1-2 weeks, I
    recommend you pay the little bit extra for a premium airline and fly direct too!`,
    desc_three:`Another thing to consider when planning a trip is to find out the transportation options in your chosen destination. Will you need to book a rental car or pre-purchase any transportation passes online? Is there a train or bus service? Are there taxis or Uber? Can you simply walk to most places?`,
    desc_four:`When you plan a trip you’ll want to know what are the must-visit tourist attractions and the best free things to do in your chosen destination. As much as we like to just show up, some trip planning is a good idea especially if you are visiting a popular destination in the peak travel season.`,
